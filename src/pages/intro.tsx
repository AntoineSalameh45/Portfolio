          <p>Well, as you may have gathered, I go by the name Antoine Salameh, 
            or BiG A for short, and I've managed to survive 23 trips around the 
            sun.
            <br></br>
            I've navigated my way through the labyrinth of WordPress and bots 
            armed with nothing but my wits, a heap of research, a library of 
            documentation, and enough tutorial videos to make even YouTube proud. 
            <br></br>
            From there, I embarked on a series of personal projects to further 
            hone my web development prowess. You'll find some of my handiwork 
            <a href='/projects'> there</a>.
            <br></br>
            Currently, I'm donning the guise of a stock manager at B.Steel, 
            but let's be realâ€”that's not my endgame. I've got my sights set 
            on conquering the web development arena, and I'll seize every 
            opportunity that comes my way.

            I did not only dedicated myself to the front-end world but also
            went to learn all type of other stuff. A little game development here,
            Discord <i className="fa-brands fa-discord"></i> bots there. Of course 
            I'll be sharing some details in my "Projects" page.
